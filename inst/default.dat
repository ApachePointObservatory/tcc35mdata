! mirror collimation coefficients
! - piston and translation coefficients are in um
! - tilt coefficients are in arc-seconds
! - value = Coef1 + Coef2 sin(alt) + Coef3 cos(alt)
! piston Coef2 = -410 um is based on:
!   secondary apparatus supported by eight 89" long 1/2" diameter steel rods
!   rods are separated 39" at secondary, 2" at other end
!   secondary apparatus weighs roughly 370 lbs
!   modulus of elasticity of steel = 30E6 psi
