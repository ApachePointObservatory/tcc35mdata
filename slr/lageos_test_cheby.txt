# appgeo: apparent geocentric; date is date of equinox (Julian years); 0 means now

# Chebyshev polynomial coefficients for track/chebyshev
# The format is minTAI  maxTAI  coeff0  coeff1...
# where:
# - minTAI and maxTAI are the minimum and maximum allowed TAI date, in MJD, seconds
#   (tracking will fail if you use these polynomials outside this date range)
# - The polynomial is evaluated with x ranging from -1 to 1 over the specified date range

#Fill in convienent time for test, this moves from 302 -> 5 in az, PCA ~54 deg elevation, 47 up to 52 down, 20 min

# Rotator angle as position velocity time (TAI, MDJ).
# Optional; defaults to nan nan nan
# The exact meaning depends on rotType (which is case sensitive):
# - object: the angle of the user coordinate system w.r.t. the instrument.
# - horizon: the angle of az/alt w.r.t the instrument
# - mount: the angle sent to the axis controller
# - none: no rotation
